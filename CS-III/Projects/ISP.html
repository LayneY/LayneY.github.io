      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Summary</h2>
      <p class="essay">
        For my ISP this year, I am working with Brett Kaplan and Logan Rohlfs to create a new Eagle Engagement application for the school. The current application is slow, half the links don't work, and overall feels outdated.
        This is why our goal is to make a new application with more features and security. The old app only had a list of events for students to check in to, but this application will include many more, such as
        club lists, club attendance, more event check in options, and anti spoofing methods.
      </p>

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">The Minga Problem</h2>
      <p class="essay">
        After working on the project for about two months, the school decided to tell us that Eagle Engagement is going to be replaced with Minga next year. Minga is a school management
        platform that can be used to create hall passes and apparently keep track of engagement points. This defeated the purpose of our project, making us have to pivot to a new goal.
        The app will no longer be intended for the use of Allen ISD, but any school district that wants to keep students engaged in the school in a fun way. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">What I Have Learned</h2>
      <p class="essay">
        Working on this project has allowed me to have experience using Kotlin to program Android applications, and using APIs in the app. I have learned about authentication APIs
        and APIs used to get data, such as a list of events.
