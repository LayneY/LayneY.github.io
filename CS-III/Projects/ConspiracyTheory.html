      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	Almost all social media platforms use some kind of recommendation algorithm to determine content that is best suited for the user. The algorithms will see what kind of content you like and how long you spend looking at it to determine if it is a good fit. If the algorithm can tell that a user likes the content that they saw, the algorithms will suggest similar content to keep the user engaged. All "big tech" companies use methods like checking what you watch, click on, like, etc to recommend similar content to you. This can be in the form of videos, ads, images, etc that the algorithm predicts you will like or find relevant. This can encourage you to buy something that would actually be useful to you, helping increase sales for companies. This is apparent in social media apps such as TikTok, which checks how long you watch a video and if you liked or shared the video to determine what kinds of videos to show you.

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">The Feedback Loop</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	The feedback loop is part of recommendation algorithms and are what helps give information to these algorithms. As someone interacts with, such as clicking, liking, disliking, etc, on a piece of content, the feedback loop takes note of the result. If it is found that the user disliked something, the algorithm will stop showing similar content and will try something different. The opposite is also true for if the user likes it, and they will be shown more similar content. The algorithm will loop through this process of showing different content and checking the result, until it can figure out the best kinds of content to show to the user. Companies such as Google Ads use the feedback loop to determine the best ads to show to users on Google and YouTube. They pay attention to how long you watch an ad and if you click on it to determine if it should keep showing you similar ads.

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	Conspiracy theories are often engaging and interesting, and many advertisers know that they can keep people around longer. When someone stays around to see an ad for longer, they are more likely to actually buy something, increasing revenue for the company. This can allow advertisers to take advantage of random conspiracy theories to try to get users to stay around for longer and increase sales. This became an issue during the COVID pandemic in 2020, as some advertisers would incorporate different theories about the virus into their ads. Some of these were inaccurate and many scared members of the public. These led to Google banning ads that include conspiracy theories about the pandemic.

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Platform Incentives</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	Most companies have a primary goal of generating as much revenue as possible. This can create a kind of "blindness" for them, if they divert a lot of their time and energy into advertising. They can sacrifice 100% truthfulness in the effort of increasing sales. This can lead to advertisments being created that provide false information or exaggerate the product's abilities and usefulness. Because companies are gearing a lot towards advertising, they spend less time checking their facts and show less factual ads.

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Potential for Exploitation</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	Because we live in 2023, the potential for something to be modified from its original version is very possible. This means advertisers can make misleading images, videos, etc to promote a conspiracy theory or encourage something to click or watch an ad for longer. The term of "clickbait" is often used to describe when a title or thumbnail is misleading and does not represent what the content really is. This can also be used to make people look like they said something they didn't, with things like voiceovers and deepfakes. It is hard to believe anything is real nowadays because of how easy it is for things to be modified and set up to look a certain way.
