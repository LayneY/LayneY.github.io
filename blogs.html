      <h2 style="text-align:center">2-May-2023: What Did IT Do This Time?</h2>
      
      <p class="essayParagraph">The Allen ISD IT department has decided that students cannot be trusted to use their own devices at school. This means that starting in the 2023-2024 school year, the BYOD network will be shut down and we will be forced to use the chromebooks that the school forces us to pay for. These devices are very limited in what they can do, and restricting technology to these devices would cause challenges for many STEAM classes, such as Computer Science and Robotics, both of which use software which cannot be accessed on a chromebook. So far, the district has not said anything about the Guest WiFi, and if they don't shut that down, students will switch to the Guest WiFi. I believe this new policy is unfair and I think IT should think about what they are planning before announcing things.</p>
