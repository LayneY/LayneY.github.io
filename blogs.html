      <h2 style="text-align:center">28-February-2024: AHS Uses Minga to Degrade Student Projects</h2>
      
      <p class="essayParagraph">
        The wonderful administration we have at Allen High School has introduced the Minga application to our school this semester. Originally, students and teachers were annoyed at
        the additional steps now required to use the restroom and get tardy passes, and the constant monitoring the school wants to have on students. Now, the school wants to implement
        Minga as the new Eagle Engagement app for next year. My project for CS-III this year was to make a new Eagle Engagement app for the school to implement next year. An 
        administrator told us about the good idea originally, and now they are taking it back. We had worked on the project for two months prior to being told about Minga taking over,
        and how we now have to pivot and go a different direction.

      <h2 style="text-align:center">2-May-2023: What Did IT Do This Time?</h2>
      
      <p class="essayParagraph">The Allen ISD IT department has decided that students cannot be trusted to use their own devices at school. This means that starting in the 2023-2024 school year, the BYOD network will be shut down and we will be forced to use the chromebooks that the school forces us to pay for. These devices are very limited in what they can do, and restricting technology to these devices would cause challenges for many STEAM classes, such as Computer Science and Robotics, both of which use software which cannot be accessed on a chromebook. So far, the district has not said anything about the Guest WiFi, and if they don't shut that down, students will switch to the Guest WiFi. I believe this new policy is unfair and I think IT should think about what they are planning before announcing things.</p>
