	There are many Physics students, so I think it would be useful, but the high competition such as Quizlet already exists for this purpose. Teachers and students can upload study sets to Quizlet for anybody to use. I don't really want to work hard to remake an app that is already really useful and popular. Students are also not likely to want to switch to an app that basically does the same thing.

	I think this is a good idea and will help with preventing people from getting in the building. However, the name of the group (Six Confused Men Corporation) kind of throws me off, and while I think this is a great idea, I also can see a few issues with it. Such as, the summary describes that the system would reduce the need for security guards at doors, but the page describes that a security guard will still have to stand by the door in case someone enters without an ID or if a visitor enters the building. I also know that the people who created this business sometimes get easily distracted which makes me not want to work with them.

	This is a great idea, and would save lots of class time, without teachers having to take attendance every day, but devices like these already exist, as we use them in our Dual Credit classes at Collin College. Whenever we enter our class, we just scan our IDs and our attendance is taken. Unfortunately, I don't really want to work on making something that already exists and the school could easily get set up. The page also does not explain what the difference would be compared to competition and the content on the page does not explain the entire business plan, and just has the main idea of the project.

	I think this is a good idea and could help computer science students, but the high competition of Merlin Maven Mentoring already exists for this purpose, and the page doesn't provide any details about what makes this different or better from Merlin Mavens. There are also not many details provided on the page about how the app will work, and only explains the goal of the application.

	While there are certain things I wish were different about search engines, a new search engine would be hard to get going, especially because of the major competitors of Google and Bing. The page also doesn't describe specific ways that this engine would be better than the ones that already exist. I am just not convinced that it would be able to be better than the big engines so I will not accept.

	This sounds like a great idea, and I personally would love to have an app like this to use. However, I feel like I have heard of something that does this before, and it is not a project I would want to spend the rest of the year working on.

      <p class="centeredParagraph">
	I think this is a good idea and could help new musicians, however, programs such as SmartMusic do something similar to this, and I, being a band student myself, think that band students are more likely to just try to learn music and practice it in time on their own instead of using other software to try to help them. The purchasing of the pad that the app would use could also be discouraging to band students.

	I like the idea and think it would be very useful for people to find new clubs, however, the Business Plan link does not work so I can not get enough information to make a decision of accepting this project. Also the development of the STEAM Life app that has many of the same features for clubs would be competition or this project.

	While this seems like a good idea based on the summary, and could help people learn programming, the page does not provide any information about the project at all, so I can not make a well-educated decision on accepting this project. There are also many sites and programs to teach people how to code, such as Codecademy, which would be a hard competition to deal with.

	This idea is similar to the idea I had for my project, but I think it is better explaining and more thought through. I also know the members of the project and know that they work hard and would make sure the project gets done.
