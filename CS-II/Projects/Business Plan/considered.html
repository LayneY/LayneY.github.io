	There are many Physics students, and  Quizlet is an application that already exists for this purpose. Teachers and students can upload study sets to Quizlet for anybody to use. I don't really want to work hard to remake an app that is already really useful and popular.

	First, the name of the group (Six Confused Men Corporation) kind of throws me off, and while I think this is a great idea, I also can see a few issues with it. Such as, the summary describes that the system would reduce the need for security guards at doors, but the page describes that a security guard will still have to stand by the door in case someone enters without an ID or if a visitor enters the building. I also know that the people who created this business sometimes get easily distracted which makes me not want to work with them.

	Devices like these already exist, as we use them in our Dual Credit classes at Collin College. Whenever we enter our class, we just scan our IDs and our attendance is taken. Unfortunately, I don't really want to work on making something that already exists and the school could easily get set up.

	Merlin Maven Mentoring already exists for this purpose, and the page doesn't provide any details about what makes this different or better from Merlin Mavens. There are also not many details provided on the page about how the app will work, and only explains the goal of the application.

	A new search engine would be hard to get going, especially because of the major competitors of Google and Bing. The page also doesn't describe specific ways that this engine would be better than the ones that already exist. I am just not convinced that it would be able to be better than the big engines so I will not accept.

	I like the idea and think it would be very useful, however, the Business Plan link does not work so I can not get enough information to make a decision of accepting this project.

	While this seems like a good idea based on the summary, the page does not provide any information about the project at all, so I can not make a well-educated decision on accepting this project.
