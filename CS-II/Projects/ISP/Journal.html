	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Software Development Engineer</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  A software development engineer designs and creates applications and systems to solve problems. They design and program these applications and/or systems to do what they need to do. I think I am a good fit for this position because I am a decent programmer and understand different languages and concepts. I do sometimes struggle with creating designs, but I think the other software engineers and I would be able to bounce ideas of each other to create a good design.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">QA Engineer</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  A QA (Quality Assurance) engineer monitors each stage of the development process. The QA Engineer will also find and fix bugs in programs before launch. I am not sure I would be a great fit for this position because I have a problem where I skip looking for bugs and just go straight to testing, and I think I would get impatient looking for bugs repeatedly. 
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Project Manager</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  Project managers oversee the planning, executing, and completing projects. They have a very important job to make sure that the project can be done on time. I think I would be good at this position because I have experience being a leader and would be able to effectively oversee the project.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Product Manager</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  Product managers oversees the development of a product. They use business strategies, design, and customer needs to help create the right product. I don't think I will be very good at this role because I sometimes struggle to come up with ideas and would end up wasting lots of time. If there were multiple product managers, I could do better because we would be able to bounce ideas off each other.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Release Engineer</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  Release engineers manage, document, and oversee software releases. They create and execute scripts that are used during software creation. I think I would be good at this position because I am a good leader and believe that I would be able to create releases for the app effectively.
