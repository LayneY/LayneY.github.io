	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Technical Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  I was working on the home page of the scheduler this week, and ran into some challenges with styling the page. I struggled to align the course selection areas where I wanted them, but eventually I was able to figure it out and get it mostly where I wanted it.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  This week was mostly everyone working on their own, so we didn't really try scheduling any meetings this week.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  There were still some conflicts between members of the team and some seem reluctant to try to resolve them. I think some team members are trying to resolve their issues, however.
	</p>

	<h2 class="essaySubtitle">16-Jan-2023</h2>
	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Technical Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  There were some challenges this week when people were trying to get Git set up on their terminals and getting the project to build and run. I managed to overcome this challenge and got the project to successfully build and run.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  We had a meeting this week over Discord. We tried to schedule it at a time where many people could come, but only a few people showed up. We will need to work harder to schedule meetings at convenient times for everyone.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  There are some issues with getting some team members to work on their page, and some team members are more aggressive than others, creating an environment that is very tense. I plan to try to stay out of the aggressive and try to help the environment stay peaceful where I can.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="essaySubtitle">9-Jan-2023</h2>
	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Technical Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  I encountered many challenges when trying to get Git set up on my terminal. The different branches made it very difficult to pull and push. Mr. Ben helped me overcome these challenges, however, and now I can use Git for the project.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  So far we have not encountered any scheduling issues, however, I am involved in many clubs and extracurriculars, so we could encounter some challenges in the coming weeks.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  This week we had some issues with multiple team members working on the same files at the same time, leading to many commits and lots of chaos on the GitHub. Eventually this was all sorted out. We also are trying to determine who the Project Manager, Product Manager, and Release Engineers are, and hopefully we will be able to have a vote by the end of next week.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="essaySubtitle">2-Jan-2023</h2>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Software Development Engineer</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  A software development engineer designs and creates applications and systems to solve problems. They design and program these applications and/or systems to do what they need to do. I think I am a good fit for this position because I am a decent programmer and understand different languages and concepts. I do sometimes struggle with creating designs, but I think the other software engineers and I would be able to bounce ideas of each other to create a good design.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">QA Engineer</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  A QA (Quality Assurance) engineer monitors each stage of the development process. The QA Engineer will also find and fix bugs in programs before launch. I am not sure I would be a great fit for this position because I have a problem where I skip looking for bugs and just go straight to testing, and I think I would get impatient looking for bugs repeatedly. 
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Project Manager</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  Project managers oversee the planning, executing, and completing projects. They have a very important job to make sure that the project can be done on time. I think I would be good at this position because I have experience being a leader and would be able to effectively oversee the project.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Product Manager</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  Product managers oversees the development of a product. They use business strategies, design, and customer needs to help create the right product. I don't think I will be very good at this role because I sometimes struggle to come up with ideas and would end up wasting lots of time. If there were multiple product managers, I could do better because we would be able to bounce ideas off each other.
	</p>

	<h3 class="journalSubtitle">Release Engineer</h3>
	<p class="journalParagraph">
	  Release engineers manage, document, and oversee software releases. They create and execute scripts that are used during software creation. I think I would be good at this position because I am a good leader and believe that I would be able to create releases for the app effectively.
