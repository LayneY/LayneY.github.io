      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	Making decisions is part of every day life. Many decisions we make can impact our lives in major ways. When making decisions about a business, it can be very important to make the best decisions possible. This can be difficult, however, especially when working with a group of people, and when everyone has different views and ideas. This can also present different levels of bias, which can greater add to the disagreement among a group. 
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Binary Thinking</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	Binary thinking is when ideas are narrowed down to two options, leaving little room for other ideas and possible better solutions. Wendy Smith, a psychologist at the University of Delaware, says that the way we like to analyze issues, "we like to analytically break issues down into opposing sides, split them apart," because open choices make people feel more anxious and uncertain (Staff, 2022). This can be a problem when we are making decisions about our ISP, especially since it is very likely that we will narrow choices down to two options just so we feel more comfortable. This can also present problems because our project will be used by all current freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, so we want to make the best decisions possible. To overcome the likeliness of binary thinking, we need to make sure we have an open mind and that we help each other not to narrow our choices down.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">The Wrecking Ball</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	When something turns out to not work, a popular solution is to swing the complete opposite direction, like a wrecking ball. This can be a result of binary thinking, because when one idea doesn't work, people can move to a completely different idea that may or may not work better. Smith talks about her own children, saying that she allowed her kids to create their own sleep schedules, but it led to one being asleep when another isn't. So she changed her strategy and would just "close the door and let the baby cry themselves to sleep for a couple nights," which also led to chaos (Staff, 2022). This can become an issue when working on our ISP, especially if we fall into binary thinking. To overcome this, we need to make sure to help each other keep an open mind and think about what may have gone wrong and try fixing that specific issue, instead of completely changing our ideas. An example for this bias is LEGO. When computer games started taking over, LEGO over corrected, moving from 6,000 types of pieces to 14,000, with 157 colors and hues. This over correction did increase revenue, but costs were so high that profits were declining. Then, when the company was almost bankrupt, new leadership came in and created "some simple rules, some boundaries, some guardrails that would allow [them] to innovate but not go so far that [they're] going to fall over and that [they're] going to fail" (Staff, 2022). This is also what we need to do to prevent this from happening in our project. We need to make sure we have limits and tht we only do what we need to do.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Contradictions</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	When working on our ISP, we also need to make sure our ideas don't contradict one another and that we think thoroughly about our ideas. When we are making decisions, we need to "pause and almost look underneath the hood or explore the structure of those choices," which will probably reveal some paradoxes where parts of our ideas go against others (Staff, 2022). Overcoming these is very important to make sure we don't run into new problems later on.
      </p>

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Imaginability</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	Imaginability happens when someone can easily imagine something, and therefore thinks that there is not a likely chance of something going wrong. It is "a result of the human ability to construct abstract models from memory" (Arnott, 1998). This would be very possible when making decisions for our ISP, because I often try to imagine ways to solve problems and underestimate the challenges I will encounter along the way. I did this a lot when making sorting algorithms this year, when the best solution was to draw it out on paper to solve the problem. When trying to make decisions, we should make sure we draw everything out to try to prevent our imaginations from trying to simplify the problem. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Testing</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	The testing bias is when part of something is properly tested, and it is assumed that other similar situations would work. This bias can be common when making decisions for our ISP, especially because there will be lots of possibilities for schedules to be made and classes to be used, so it would be very possible for some things to be tested correctly and not other things. Since this is programming, there is lots of room for slight mistakes and errors, so we need to make sure we always test everything thoroughly, so that there can be as few issues as possible in our project.
      </p>

      <h2 class="essaySubtitle">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="essay">
	We make decisions all the time, and biases are very common when decisions are made. However, this biases can be overcome, and while it may be challenging, it is possible and will be worth it in the long run.
