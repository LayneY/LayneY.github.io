      <p class="essay">
	Artificial intelligence is getting better and better every day, able to perform more tasks on its own. Robots are becoming smarter, and it's getting scary what they are learning to do. With the direction it's going currently, sentient AI will be very beneficial in our lives because of the tasks it will be able to perform on it's own, but it will also cause problems because robots will be able to take over all our jobs completely which could lead to the downfall of humans.
	<br>
	<br>
	Sentient AI will be very beneficial to humans because it will be able to do things that people can not or do not want to do. AI is already useful for tasks such as translation for when you travel to another country, but it can also "generate tweets, pen poetry, summarize emails, answer trivia questions... and even write computer programs" (Metz, 2022). The Roomba vacuum is already to able to clean your house on its own, even when you aren't home. THe Roomba vacuum is already making people's lives easier, being one less thing people have to think about. Sentient AI will be great to have for things that humans are unable to do on their own, and will be very helpful in making our lives easier.
	<br>
	<br>
	While sentient AI will be benficial, it can also be dangerous if it gets too advanced. AI has been evolving a lot in the past few years, and OpenAI's GPT-3 is "being used to write screenplays, compose marketing emails, and develop video games" (Roose, 2022). AI is getting very smart, and is even being used to write code with GitHub's Copilot. If AI is able to take all of our jobs, there will be nothing for humans to do themselves. Ajeya Cotra said two years ago that "there was a 15 percent chance" of AI that can make large economic or social changes, but she "raised that to a 35 percent chance" due to AI's rapid improvement (Roose, 2022). AI could also be used to "spread disinformation across the internet-fake text and fake images" which would be able to persuade people to think and act in certain ways. If AI gets too smart, it would be capable of wiping us out and completely taking over.
	<br>
	<br>
	AI is getting better, and there is not much we can do to stop it. Sentient AI will be beneficial to humans in that it will be able to perform tasks that we can not do and help make our lives easier. However, if AI gets too advanced, I believe they will be able to take our jobs and lead to a downfall of humanity.
