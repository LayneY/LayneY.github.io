	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Our ISP was to create a game using Igis. Our game is called Stick Jump and is a platformer type game.</p>
	
	<br>
	<h2>Concept</h2>
	<p>A platformer game is a 2D game where the character has to move around and jump to different<br>platforms on the level.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Motivation</h2>
	<p>When we were deciding on the kind of game to make, we all recalled playing platform games<br>such as Mario. This was the motivation for us making a platformer game.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Code</h2>

	</span>
	<p>
	  The calculate() function is what deals with gravity in the game. When on a platform, the
	  <br>
	  character will not be able to go through it unless it is lava.
	  <br>
	  The moveForward(), moveBackward(), and jump() functions are called when the appropriate
	  <br>
	  keys are pressed. The forward and backwards functions update each frame of the character
	  <br>
	  so the character is in the right place. The jump function changes the character's
	  <br>
	  velocity so that it will go upwards. The calculate function then deals with bringing
	  <br>
	  the character back down.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	  We encountered many issues while making this game. The hardest part was making gravity
	  <br>
	  work as it should, along with trying to make the game fit on a variety of screen sizes.
	  <br>
	  Overall, however, I am happy with how the game turned out in the end and how our
	  <br>
	  presentation went.
